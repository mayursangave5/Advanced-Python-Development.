## 📌 Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### 📝 Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is **even or odd** using an `if-else` statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

### 💻 Program Logic
- If the number is divisible by 2, it is **Even**.
- Otherwise, it is **Odd**.

## 📌 Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

### 📝 Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from **1 to 50**.
2. Calculates the **sum** of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

### 💻 Program Logic
- Initialize a variable `sum = 0`.
- Use a `for` loop to add numbers from 1 to 50.
- Print the final value of `sum`.
